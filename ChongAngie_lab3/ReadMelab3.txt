problemm1.asm
================================================
In this problem we are given the task to create a search function
that takes in three parameters; the starting address, the array size, and the seed value.
This program is quite simple to run as the user will just need to compile and the
text should be shown in the console window in the SPIM simulator.

====================================================
problem2_part1.asm - This will have a function called AddSub that will perform the equation
that X is Y + Z if the flag is equal to zero and Y - Z if flag is equal to one. We need to implement stacks
to pass the five parameters and need to show the data sets of array Y and Z first, then X for set values.
