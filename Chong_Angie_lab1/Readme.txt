program_1.asm
================================================
In program_1.asm, the task was to create a MIPS assembly that will pring out "Hello World."
This program is quite simply to run as the user will just need to compile and the
text should be shown in the console window in the SPIM simulator.

program_2.asm
====================================================
In program_2.asm, the task was to write in MIPS assembly language that reads the integers 4, -4, 64679, and - 64679 and load
them into registers $s0 to $s3.  Then we are to perform the different opertation of printing the user input,
add $s2 and $s3 and print out the results, perform logical OR on constant 4 and $s3 and print out the results,
and lastly shift $s3 one bit to the left and print out the results.
