p1
================================================
In p1, the task was to process two integer arrays of size 20 which were raw and fresh. these would show an ouput of the sum, the largest and smallest of Raw and store the sum, the largest and smallest of Fresh in memory.

The sum of the Fresh array is: 210
In the Fresh array, the MAX value is: 20
In the Fresh array, the MIN value is: 1
The MIN and MAX value added is: 21
The sum of the Raw Array is: 20
In the Raw Array, the MAX value is: 72
In the Raw Array, the MIN value is: 2
The MIN and MAX value added is: 74

Exit.

p2.asm
====================================================
In p2.asm, we were supposed to write an efficient algorithm that would perform
some tasks such as to initialize the array of size 10, to divide if even and to multiply if odd,
swap the elements with each other, and to print out the results.
